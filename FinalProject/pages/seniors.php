This way you can enjoy the benefits of cohousing without the need to go through the process of establishing the project itself or the financial burden of buying a unit in such a project.
                    We offer accommodation in a community of one hundred people. This is the optimal number when there are enough people to communicate but not too many to get to know each other and get close.
                    We offer not just cohousing, but also numerous services that you may need. Such as:</p>
                <ul class="mb-5 fs-5 fw-light">
                    <li>Medical center where geriatricians are the primary care doctors</li>
                    <li>Gym with training programs developed specially for seniors </li>

                    <p class="text-white fs-5 fw-light">A guest house where seniors children and other family members could stay when they visit the seniors will be a great addition to the project.</p>
                    <p class="text-white fs-5 fw-light">We understand the needs of the seniors. We know, while the majority of seniors do not need special care services, we could establish a facility dedicated to seniors who would need special care. The purpose of this facility is that if a senior needs change after joining the community, they would not need to look for another type of accommodation. It would be cruel to ask a senior who has lived in the community and established bonds with other seniors to leave when they are most vulnerable!</p>

                <p class=" fs-5 fw-light mt-5">Each cohousing community will have many options that suit the different needs for different seniors. The units could be a one bedroom or two bed-rooms or even more. A senior could choose to share a unit with other seniors for social and financial convenience or live in a unit by themselves if the senior wishes but still within a larger community of seniors.</p>
                <p class=" fs-5 fw-light">At every cohousing community could have common green areas and houses rooftops could be converted into green houses where seniors can garden anytime of the year. And it is always fun to cook a meal using the food you grow with your friends and neighbors but we need first to have a community for activities like these to take place. This is just one example of how these communities will be developed around what seniors like to do and enjoy.</p>
                <p class=" fs-5 fw-light mb-4">Building the homes to be as accessible and as "smart" as possible is one of our priorities. Support software and smart devices will make you life easier and more convenient. In addition to the convenience, smart technology adds a component of safety will highly appreciated by you. So while you and all seniors will enjoy the dynamic of the community while together, you will enjoy all the benefits that come with the new technology in your homes.</p>
